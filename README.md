## Project Description 
Hello, We are the students of Stamford University Bangladesh. Bringing to all the new solution of preventing dengue mosquito's habitat. Also, Providing the idea of quick cleaning solution of our city to reduce dengue and all kinds of mosquito related problems.  

400 million peoples around the world are getting infected with dengue virus every year. Pollution of the city and stucked water is creating large impact on mosquito habitat.Most of them can be simply avoided by reducing the mosquito habitat.

When we are creating this project, more than 200 patients hospitalized just because of dengue in last 24 hours. So our team will take the responsibility of reducing the dengue mosquito habitat of the Dhaka City. We divided the Dhaka city into 7 separate zones using map APi. The main idea of this separation is to provide a weekly cleaning solution to the each zone.

We are working on the local people report.Local people can report directly to us using our system. Based on everyday report, We created a dataset of pollution. Our cleaner team will work one day of a week in each zone. Also based on reported data, if we find more than 25% reports from a zone than others. We will send our team to that zone using priority basis. This will help us to provide a quick clean solution for our city.
