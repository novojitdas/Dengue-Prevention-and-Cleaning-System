## Project Description 
Hello, We are the students of Stamford University Bangladesh. Bringing to all the new solution of preventing dengue mosquito's habitat. Also, Providing the idea of quick cleaning solution of our city to reduce dengue and all kinds of mosquito related problems.

400 million peoples around the world are getting infected with dengue virus every year. Pollution of the city and stucked water is creating large impact on mosquito habitat.Most of them can be simply avoided by reducing the mosquito habitat. For that reason we need proper & fast cleaning solution.

When we are creating this project, more than 200 patients hospitalized just because of dengue in last 24 hours. So our team will take the responsibility of reducing the dengue mosquito habitat of the Dhaka City. We are using OpenStreetMap and Nasa Globe Data for mosquito habitat on our project.

We have two ideas.

First one is user based cleaning solution. Second one is priority  cleaning based on user reports.

At the first we need to work on the report of local people. Local people will directly report to us using our system. Based on the report, our volunteer will be able to identify the reported places, which needs cleaning. After the cleaning that place, they will mark that place as cleaned. So we don't need to take the hassle of finding the polluted place every time.  

Also we have the future plan of divide the Dhaka city into 7 separate zones using map OpenStreetMap API. The main idea of this separation is to provide a weekly cleaning solution to the each zone.

Our cleaner team of city corporation will work one day of a week in each zone. Also based on reported data, if we find more than 25% reports from a zone than others. We will send our team to that zone using priority basis. This will help us to provide a quick clean solution for our city.
